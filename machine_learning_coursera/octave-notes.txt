Octave supports "native" plotting using OpenGL and FLTK. You can activate
it for all future figures using the Octave command

    graphics_toolkit ("fltk")

or for a specific figure handle h using

    graphics_toolkit (h, "fltk")

Otherwise, gnuplot is still used by default, if available.
When plotting with gnuplot, you should set "GNUTERM=x11" before running octave;
if you are using Aquaterm, use "GNUTERM=aqua".
